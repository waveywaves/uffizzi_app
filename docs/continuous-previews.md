## INTRODUCTION-

# Why this Open Source Project is Needed:

These are our observations after 2+ years interviewing over 150+ developers, DevOps, and cross-functional team members across a variety of industries and at various levels of business maturity - from nascent start-ups to long-running enterprises:

-It's universally beneficial to bring QA into the Development process, to catch issues early, iterate quickly, and to merge clean code into Develop or Main.

-Virtually all teams from can benefit from an on-demand preview environment capability and industry defined best practices.

-Many teams - typically more advanced teams with time, resources, and expertise - build and maintain an Internal Development Platform (IDP) to address a Preview requirement.

-Most teams lack the time, resources, and expertise to build and maintain an internal capability - for most a Preview tool is on a wish list.

-As a community we are not actively collaborating or innovating towards a well-defined Preview Process and technical capability: we should be. 

-There's no official Open Source Preview specific tool within the CNCF.  There are several CI, CD, and deployment tools within the CNCF and more broadly across the industry.  These tools, while useful, are not purpose built for the task of Previewing.  They fit in the Ops and DevOps lane and do not provide a Developer friendly interface for configuration.  

-Docker compose is a configuration-as-code format that best balances DevOps requirements (GitOps, Infrastructure-as-code, Functionality) with Developer accessibility.

-Previewing should be more about collaboration between the teammate(s) writing the code and the teammate(s) previewing what they've done than it is about deploying - "Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools." https://agilemanifesto.org/

-The maturity of cloud native development, containerization, and container orchestration have laid the foundation for a Preview capability and best practices that nearly all teams can benefit from.

# What this Project/Team aims to accomplish:

-Lead a community effort to define best practices for Previewing and to provide a modular, purpose-built, open source Preview engine that will more broadly enable teams to benefit from a Preview capability.

-Provide well-defined guidelines for Previewing - see https://continuous-previews.org
